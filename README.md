This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

## 개요

Next.js는 현대적인 웹 애플리케이션을 구축하기 위한 오픈 소스 JavaScript 프레임워크입니다.   
React 기반으로 작동하며, 서버 사이드 렌더링(SSR)과 정적 사이트 생성(Static Site Generation, SSG)을    지원합니다. 이는 웹사이트의 성능을 향상시키고, 검색 엔진 최적화(SEO)에 유리하게 작용합니다.

Creating a new Next.js app in C:\Users\line\Desktop\WEBS1111\next-project.   

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
